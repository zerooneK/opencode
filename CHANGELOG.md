### Set orchestrator as default agent and hide agent selector

- `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` — added `default_agent: "orchestrator"` so the orchestrator is always the entry point for users
- `packages/opencode/src/agent/agent.ts` — marked `build` and `plan` agents as `hidden: true` so they no longer appear in UI lists but still work in the background when called by the orchestrator
- `packages/app/src/components/prompt-input.tsx` — removed the agent selector dropdown from the chat input bar so users only talk to the orchestrator

**Why:** Normal users should not need to pick agents manually. The orchestrator handles routing silently behind the scenes, giving a simpler ChatGPT-like experience.
